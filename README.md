# IdentityOS

**The Open Identity Specification for AI**

> *Inspired by the anime Pluto — where every robot had its own unique soul.*

---

## What is this?

IdentityOS is **not another AI wrapper**.

It's an **open standard** for portable, versionable, persistent digital identities in AI systems.

Just as HTTP enabled the web and Docker enabled containers, **IdentityOS aims to enable a world where:**

- ✅ Identities are **portable** (run on any compliant runtime)
- ✅ Vendors compete on **execution**, not **lock-in**
- ✅ Users **own** their AI relationships
- ✅ Innovation happens at the **runtime layer**, not the **format layer**

---

## The Problem

Today's AI systems couple identity with execution:

- ChatGPT conversations exist only in ChatGPT
- Claude Projects live only in Claude  
- Custom GPTs are locked to OpenAI's infrastructure

This creates:
- **Vendor lock-in**: You cannot take "your AI" elsewhere
- **Fragmentation**: Every provider reinvents identity from scratch  
- **No continuity**: Conversations reset, context is lost

---

## The Solution

### Define identity as a portable data structure, separate from any runtime.

An identity conforming to OIS (Open Identity Specification) is:

- **Portable**: Runs on any compliant runtime  
- **Versionable**: Can be snapshotted, diffed, and rolled back  
- **Persistent**: Survives model changes, infrastructure migrations  
- **Composable**: Can be transferred, forked, merged

---

## Architecture

IdentityOS organizes identity state into **12 bounded modules**:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Core metadata (id, name, persona) |
| **Timeline** | Chronological biography (Git history for identities) |
| **Experience** | Accumulated interactions and memories |
| **Knowledge** | Domain-specific declarative knowledge |
| **Skills** | Executable capabilities (tools, APIs) |
| **Capabilities** | Physical/environmental affordances (vision, speech, locomotion) |
| **Permissions** | Authorization scopes (what the identity is *allowed* to do) |
| **Motivations** | Goals, drives, priorities |
| **Policies** | Behavioral constraints and rules |
| **Relationships** | Graph of connections to other identities/entities |
| **Health** | Observable metrics (saturation, stability, drift) |
| **Evaluation** | Performance reports and feedback |

### Each module is:
- **Self-contained**: Clean interfaces, no hidden dependencies
- **Spec-compliant**: Conforms to `spec/identity.schema.json`  
- **Portable**: Can be serialized/deserialized to JSON

---

## This is a Standard, Not a Product

**IdentityOS** is structured in three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  spec/  — The Open Identity Specification │  ← The Standard (JSON Schema)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  core/ runtime/ — Reference Runtime      │  ← Proof that the spec works
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  cli/ adapters/ — Applications           │  ← How humans interact
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Specification (`spec/`) can exist without the runtime.

Someone can build:
- **Microsoft Runtime**  
- **Google Runtime**  
- **OpenAI Runtime**  
- **Local Runtime**

...all implementing the same **Identity Specification**.

That's how ecosystems emerge.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Identity as Infrastructure

Identities are not features of chat apps.  
Chat is a feature of identities.

### 2. Capabilities vs Skills

- **Skills** are *declared*: "This identity can search the web"  
- **Capabilities** are *discovered*: "This identity has access to a camera"

A robot identity discovers:
- `walking` (if deployed on a mobile chassis)  
- `vision` (if cameras are connected)  
- `manipulation` (if equipped with arms)

A cloud identity discovers:
- `internet` (always available)  
- `file_system` (if sandbox permits)

Capabilities decouple identity from physical embodiment.

### 3. Permissions vs Policies

- **Policies** describe *behavior*: "Never reveal PII"  
- **Permissions** describe *authority*: "Allowed to read:records, denied delete:evidence"

Example:

**Officer Maya**
- **Allowed**: `read:records`, `write:logs`, `use:vehicle`  
- **Denied**: `delete:evidence`, `approve:warrants`

Runtimes **enforce** permissions at execution time.

### 4. Identity Health

Monitor identity stability over time:

```
Identity Health Report
  Memory Saturation    : 92%  ⚠️
  Knowledge Freshness  : 67%
  Relationship Drift   : 4%
  Goal Completion      : 81%
  Identity Stability   : 98%  ✅
  Policy Violations    : 0     ✅
```

Health metrics trigger automatic maintenance (pruning, refresh, etc.).

---

## Specification Format

OIS identities are serialized as **JSON** conforming to JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.

**Canonical schema:**  
`spec/identity.schema.json`

**Minimal valid identity:**

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "identity": {
    "id": "mentor-01",
    "name": "Mentor AI",
    "persona": "mentor"
  },
  "created_at": 1689724800.0,
  "timeline": {"events": []},
  "experience": {"entries": []},
  "knowledge": {"packs": []},
  "skills": {"available": []},
  "capabilities": {"available": []},
  "permissions": {"allowed": [], "denied": []},
  "motivations": {"active": []},
  "policies": {"rules": []},
  "relationships": {"nodes": [], "edges": []},
  "health": {},
  "evaluation": {"reports": []}
}
```

Full specification: [spec/SPEC.md](spec/SPEC.md)

---

## Runtime Conformance

A compliant runtime MUST:
1. **Load** identities from OIS JSON format  
2. **Execute** sessions that modify identity state  
3. **Save** state changes back to OIS format  
4. **Export** identities without data loss

A compliant runtime MAY:
- Support multiple storage backends (JSON, SQLite, cloud)  
- Provide snapshot/rollback features  
- Implement health monitoring  
- Offer multi-identity orchestration

Extensions MUST NOT:
- Break schema validation  
- Prevent portability to other runtimes

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lacebx/IdentityOS.git
cd IdentityOS
pip install -r runtime/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create an identity

```bash
python -m cli.main create --name "Mentor" --persona mentor --id mentor-01
```

### 3. Start a session

```bash
python -m cli.main session --id mentor-01
```

### 4. Inspect the identity

```bash
python -m cli.main inspect --id mentor-01
```

### 5. View snapshot history

```bash
python -m cli.main history --id mentor-01
```

### 6. Rollback to a prior version

```bash
python -m cli.main rollback --id mentor-01 --snap <snapshot_id>
```

## Philosophy

### This is not about better prompts.

This is about **persistent entities that grow, remember, and relate** — across any model, any runtime, any session.

### The specification becomes sacred.

`identity.json` is more important than `runtime.py`.

The companies that end up becoming foundational—whether it's Docker, HashiCorp, Stripe, or Kubernetes—tend to win not because they own every implementation, but because they **define clean interfaces** that other people adopt.

If IdentityOS succeeds, the long-term value may come less from "having the best runtime" and more from being the project that **defines how persistent digital identities are represented, versioned, evaluated, transferred, and deployed** across the AI ecosystem.

## Questions?

**Q: Is this just a wrapper around ChatGPT?**  
No. IdentityOS defines a **standard**, not a product. Any runtime can implement it.

**Q: Why JSON? Why not protobuf/YAML/etc.?**  
JSON is universal, human-readable, and schema-validatable. OIS may define alternate serializations in future versions.

**Q: Can I use this in production today?**  
OIS v1.0 is in draft. Early adopters are encouraged. Breaking changes are possible before 1.0 final.

**Q: Who controls the spec?**  
The community. Proposed governance: **Open Identity Foundation** (to be established).

1. **Resolve** — load identity spec
2. **Input Policy** — gate input content
3. **Compose Context** — assemble identity + memory + skills + goals
4. **Adapter** — invoke LLM (via pluggable adapter)
5. **Output Policy** — gate output content
6. **Evaluate** — score quality, detect memorable content
7. **Store** — persist interaction in memory
8. **Respond** — return result to caller
